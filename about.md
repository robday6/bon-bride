quote: I want to offer alternative options and for each collection to evolve with
  a new generation of modern women. It is not “timeless” and it doesn’t claim to create
  “classic” pieces. It’s of the moment and it celebrates the women of this moment
  in time, the bride of now.
author: Pippa Cooke
paragraph-2: Whether from the collection or the bespoke service, BON BRIDÉ defines
  itself by making each dress unique. The personalised service offers an exclusive
  experience that has been the founder’s aspiration since she got married herself
  in 2013.
quote-2: No one dress can suit everyone and nor should it, I want to offer flexibility
  for every bride to put their own stamp on their look

section-title: Sustainability
paragraph-3: "BON BRIDÉ looks to remodel the bridal industry towards sustainability.
  What is more wasteful than a dress you only wear once and for a maximum of 12 hours?
  We want to create garments that are made with conscience, so our brides can be proud
  that they have purchased their dress with a sustainability ethos in mind. Responsible
  for more than 8% of the global climate pollution, the fashion industry is slowly
  opening its eyes to sustainability. At BON BRIDÉ we are passionate about our environment
  and the day to day footprint we all have. We may only make a small contribution
  to a much larger problem, but to us, every step counts and that attitude is core
  to our brand. \n"
quote-3: I want to create sustainable dresses, that can even be worn again. We now
  offer our brides the option of having their dress amended, so they can re-use and
  wear time and time again.

Founder and creative director of BON BRIDÉ is ex fashion buyer and product developer, Pippa Cooke. Having spent over ten years immersed in the industry, buying for retail giant Topshop, cult label House of Hackney and Luxury department store Harrods, Pippa felt the time was right to adopt her fashion forward aesthetic and disrupt the bridal industry.

With BON BRIDÉ, Pippa creates understated yet striking dresses about women and for women who dress for themselves. With feminist principles at its core, BON BRIDÉ does things differently, breaking from the norms of the modern wedding.
